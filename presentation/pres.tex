\setbeamertemplate{itemize items}[triangle]
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Africa's Voices: Opinion polling done by broadcasting a variety of questions from several radio stations, where answers were received as SMS messages.
\item Main problem: The SMS messages were in different languages and sometimes included irrelevant information, such as details of the sender.
\item Sub-problem: Machine translation is not feasible for minority languages with little economic value. As a result of this, translation was taken to be an expensive task.
\item Problem we're trying to solve: allow for easy detection of opinion trends in such data, despite it being in several languages.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Our goals}
\setbeamertemplate{itemize items}[triangle]
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item This is a tool for scientists --- it should have a friendly and interactive UI while not getting in the way.
\item Due to translation being expensive, we need to allow for the researchers to determine more important words/topics for which they can prioritise translation.
\end{itemize}

\onslide<+->{Additional requirements set along the way:}

% \pause
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Allow for identification of the language that a message was written in.
\item Allow for `cleaning up' of the data by removing names, {\tt txt-speak} and other slang.
\end{itemize}
